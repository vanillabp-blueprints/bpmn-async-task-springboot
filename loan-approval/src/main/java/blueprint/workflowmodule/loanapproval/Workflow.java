/**
 * What the application tells the process: the outgoing half of the BPMN wiring.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link Service} calls in, naming what happened in business terms
 * ({@code partnerApproved}), and this class translates that into whatever the process
 * needs: starting a workflow, correlating a message, completing a task.
 * {@link ProcessService} is injected here and nowhere else.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both methods have to run in a transaction, which is why the class carries
 * {@code @Transactional}: the aggregate is saved along with the answer, and on a remote
 * BPMS the answer is only sent after that transaction committed. A rollback therefore
 * takes the completion with it and leaves the task open, rather than completing a task
 * for work that was undone.
